This repository implements Long short-term memory-based deep recurrent neural networks for target tracking (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025519305778).

The implementation is for educational purpose only and currently not under any quality control measures. 
It is not implemented by the paper's authors, however, uses the public data published by the paper's authors (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/48yt3j4j2p/1).
