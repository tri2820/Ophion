Third party implementation of a paper.

This repository implements Long short-term memory-based deep recurrent neural networks for target tracking. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025519305778)


The code is for educational purpose and currently not under any quality control measures. It is not implemented by the paper's authors and therefore not in their responsibilities. 

This code uses the data published by the paper's authors (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/48yt3j4j2p/1). Before training the models, download and extract data.rar into ./data.
